# gofor
gofor is a simple application that is ran as a server that will make multiple
calls based on the URL suffix to multiple HTTP endpoints that allows a return 
of which ever backend answers first. 

This is useful in cases were you may have multiple sources of data that is the same
but there is no control between the two data sources. Gofor allows to query both
sources for the information and ensures it gets the fastest response.
